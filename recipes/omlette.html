        <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup bell peppers, diced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup onion, diced</li>

        <li>In a bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk until well combined. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil or butter in a non-stick skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the diced bell peppers and onion to the skillet. Saut√© for about 2-3 minutes until they start to soften.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped spinach and cook for another minute until wilted.</li>
        <li>Pour the egg mixture into the skillet, ensuring it covers the vegetables evenly.</li>
        <li>Cook for about 3-4 minutes, gently lifting the edges with a spatula to allow uncooked egg to flow underneath.</li>
        <li>If using cheese, sprinkle it on top of the omelette just before it finishes cooking.</li>
        <li>Once the eggs are set but still slightly soft, fold the omelette in half and slide it onto a plate.</li>
        <li>Serve hot, optionally garnished with fresh herbs or additional cheese.</li>
