    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A classic cheeseburger with a juicy beef patty, melted cheese, fresh lettuce, tomato, and pickles, served on a toasted bun. Perfect for a quick lunch or dinner.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef (80/20 blend recommended)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>4 slices of cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
        <li>1 cup lettuce, shredded</li>
        <li>1 tomato, sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pickles, sliced</li>
        <li>Ketchup and mustard (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your grill or stovetop skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Divide the ground beef into 4 equal portions and shape them into patties. Make a slight indentation in the center of each patty to prevent it from puffing up while cooking.</li>
        <li>Season both sides of the patties with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Place the patties on the grill or skillet. Cook for about 3-4 minutes on one side, then flip them over.</li>
        <li>After flipping, place a slice of cheddar cheese on each patty and cook for an additional 3-4 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the burger is cooked to your desired doneness.</li>
        <li>While the burgers are cooking, toast the hamburger buns on the grill or in a toaster until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Assemble the burgers by placing a patty on each bun, followed by lettuce, tomato slices, pickles, and any additional condiments you like (ketchup, mustard, etc.).</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with your favorite side dishes like fries or a salad.</li>
